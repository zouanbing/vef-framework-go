// Service is the programmatic control surface of the approval engine: every
// runtime operation the approval/instance and approval/admin API resources
// expose, callable from host code without an HTTP principal. The API
// resources are themselves callers of this interface, so an operation behaves
// identically whether a request or a host routine triggered it — the same
// validation, the same domain events, audit rows, lifecycle hooks and
// business write-back. Inject it via DI; it is available whenever
// vef.ApprovalModule is enabled.
//
// Authorization is the caller's, not this interface's. The RBAC tokens that
// gate the HTTP endpoints live on the API operations, so the commands behind
// them enforce only the tenant scope carried by Caller: TerminateInstance,
// ReassignTask and RetryBusinessProjection never check that the operator is
// an administrator. A host putting any of them behind its own endpoint owns
// that check.
//
// Every method takes the orm.DB handle the operation runs on. The handle
// decides the transaction boundary: pass the handle of an open RunInTx scope
// and the operation joins that transaction, so a business write and the
// approval action it triggers commit or roll back together; pass a plain
// handle and the operation opens (and commits) a transaction of its own. The
// handle is explicit rather than read off the context because orm.DB.RunInTx
// does not attach the transaction handle to the context it hands the callback
// — a method that only took a context would silently open a second,
// independent transaction inside the caller's. A nil handle is rejected with
// ErrDBRequired rather than defaulted to the framework's own. The handle must
// belong to the primary data source (approval tables live there, and the
// domain events publish with event.WithTx against it).
//
// When joining a transaction, pass the context RunInTx hands the callback —
// not the one you called RunInTx with. RunInTx does put one thing on that
// context: the commit-hook registry orm.OnCommit reads, through which the
// tx_memory event transport defers delivery. Under a route that uses
// tx_memory the outer context therefore fails the publish with
// orm.ErrNoCommitScope and rolls the whole action back:
//
//	db.RunInTx(ctx, func(txCtx context.Context, tx orm.DB) error {
//		if err := writeBusinessRow(txCtx, tx); err != nil {
//			return err
//		}
//
//		return svc.ApproveTask(txCtx, tx, in)
//	})
//
// Audit columns (created_by / updated_by) render the operator bound on the
// handle, and orm.DB.WithNamedArg is pool-scoped only — it panics on a
// transaction handle. Bind the person before opening the transaction and pass
// the tx that handle yields:
//
//	acting := db.WithNamedArg(orm.PlaceholderKeyOperator, userID)
//	acting.RunInTx(ctx, func(txCtx context.Context, tx orm.DB) error { … })
//
// A handle carrying no operator — the injected primary orm.DB — writes
// orm.OperatorSystem into those columns. The action log records Input.Operator
// either way, so an unbound handle costs row-level attribution, not the audit
// trail.
//
// Errors are the public sentinels in api_errors.go (ErrFlowNotActive,
// ErrNotAllowedInitiate, ErrTaskNotPending, …), matchable with errors.Is.
//
// Flow-definition management (create / deploy / publish / update) is
// deliberately not part of this contract: it is design-time administration
// with a different trust posture, served by the approval/flow resource.
