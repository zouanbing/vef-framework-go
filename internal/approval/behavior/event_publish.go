// transactional publish. Returns nil when there are no events.

// Producers must call it at the moment the event occurs rather than
// accumulating a local slice to hand over at the end of the handler. The
// collector is one ordered buffer shared by the command handler, the node
// service, and the engine's recursive traversal, so a producer that defers its
// own events lets later-occurring ones overtake them: that is how

// projects its payload OccurredTime onto Envelope.OccurredAt so downstream
// consumers see business time rather than publish time.
