// validateInitiatorRules enforces that a flow's initiation setting and its

// The setting and the rules are mutually exclusive because permission checking
// short-circuits on isAllInitiationAllowed and never reads the rules — storing
// rules alongside it would display a restriction that does not hold.
//
// Requiring rules on a restricted flow serves two ends. Such a flow could
// otherwise be started by nobody, since the permission check fails closed on an
// empty rule set. And it makes the stored state a bijection, so an empty
// initiator list means exactly "open to everyone" and a single query answers
// who may start a flow.
//
// A rule itself must name a registered kind and carry the input that kind
// declares. Both come from the boot-registered InitiatorResolver set rather
// than from a closed enum here, so a host kind — "any ward supervisor", say —
// is validated exactly like a built-in one. A kind that needs no selection at
// all is legitimate and carries no IDs; only the kinds whose SelectionMode
// picks from a catalog must select something, because a rule that selects
// nobody matches nobody while looking restricted and functional.
