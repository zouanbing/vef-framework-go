// redirect, where the browser can still be told what went wrong, instead of
// after it as an opaque login error on a blank page.

// key it by HashOpaqueToken so a store leak yields no live codes, and hold it

// by the same identifier (a shared HR master, for instance). Implement it when
// the identifiers differ, or when the mapping depends on which external system
// initiated the handoff.
//
// Either way, resolution is an authentication decision: the external system
// vouched for who the user is, not for whether this application still admits
// them. Whichever of the two runs must therefore refuse a disabled, locked or
// expired account — returning a nil principal — exactly as the password path
// does. Applications commonly keep that check in UserLoader.LoadByUsername
// alone, where trust login never reaches it.
